a familiar way to play the Korean children's game 무궁화 꽃이 피었습니다 (Red Light, Green Light). 

space or click "시작"/mask to start.

space to begin next round when at RED LIGHT. 

"R" key to restart back to start screen at any time.

lightweight; all-in-one HTML file long as you have assets folder in the same directory.

next version in works currently:

planning on adding mobile QOLs next later down the line
